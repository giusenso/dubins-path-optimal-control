## Markov-Dubins Problem: an Optimal Control Approach

Author: Giuseppe Sensolini Arr√†, *Sapienza university of Rome*.  
Note: this work was developed in the context of the *Optimal Control* course of the MSc in *Control Engineering*..

The aim of this report is to discuss and revisit some well known results of the Dubins theory from an optimal control point of view. Optimal solutions are found by means of Pontryagin Maximum principle; the rest of the work is focused on the characterization of singular and nonsingular solutions. Simulations conclude the report.
